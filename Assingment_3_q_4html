        Inheritance is a key feature in CSS; it relies on the
        ancestor-descendant relationship to operate. Inheritance is the
        mechanism by which properties are applied not only to a specified
        element, but also to its descendants.[16] Inheritance relies on the
        document tree, which is the hierarchy of XHTML elements in a page based
        on nesting. Descendant elements may inherit CSS property values from any
        ancestor element enclosing them. In general, descendant elements inherit
        text-related properties, but their box-related properties are not
        inherited. Properties that can be inherited are color, font,
        letter-spacing, line-height, list-style, text-align, text-indent,
        text-transform, visibility, white-space and word-spacing. Properties
        that cannot be inherited are background, border, display, float and
        clear, height, and width, margin, min- and max-height and -width,
        outline, overflow, padding, position, text-decoration, vertical-align
        and z-index. Inheritance can be used to avoid declaring certain
        properties over and over again in a style sheet, allowing for shorter
        CSS. Inheritance in CSS is not the same as inheritance in class-based
        programming languages, where it is possible to define class B as "like
        class A, but with modifications".[18] With CSS, it is possible to style
        an element with "class A, but with modifications". However, it is not
        possible to define a CSS class B like that, which could then be used to
        style multiple elements without having to repeat the modifications. CSS
        was first proposed by HÃ¥kon Wium Lie on October 10, 1994.[22] At the
        time, Lie was working with Tim Berners-Lee at CERN.[23] Several other
        style sheet languages for the web were proposed around the same time,
        and discussions on public mailing lists and inside World Wide Web
        Consortium resulted in the first W3C CSS Recommendation (CSS1)[24] being
        released in 1996. In particular, a proposal by Bert Bos was influential;
        he became co-author of CSS1, and is regarded as co-creator of CSS.[25]
        Style sheets have existed in one form or another since the beginnings of
        Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) in the 1980s, and CSS was
        developed to provide style sheets for the web.[26] One requirement for a
        web style sheet language was for style sheets to come from different
        sources on the web. Therefore, existing style sheet languages like DSSSL
        and FOSI were not suitable. CSS, on the other hand, let a document's
        style be influenced by multiple style sheets by way of "cascading"
        styles.[26] As HTML grew, it came to encompass a wider variety of
        stylistic capabilities to meet the demands of web developers. This
        evolution gave the designer more control over site appearance, at the
        cost of more complex HTML. Variations in web browser implementations,
        such as ViolaWWW and WorldWideWeb,[27] made consistent site appearance
        difficult, and users had less control over how web content was
        displayed. The browser/editor developed by Tim Berners-Lee had style
        sheets that were hard-coded into the program. The style sheets could
        therefore not be linked to documents on the web.[23] Robert Cailliau,
        also of CERN, wanted to separate the structure from the presentation so
        that different style sheets could describe different presentation for
        printing, screen-based presentations, and editors.[27] Improving web
        presentation capabilities was a topic of interest to many in the web
        community and nine different style sheet languages were proposed on the
        www-style mailing list.[26] Of these nine proposals, two were especially
        influential on what became CSS: Cascading HTML Style Sheets[22] and
        Stream-based Style Sheet Proposal (SSP).[25][28] Two browsers served as
        testbeds for the initial proposals; Lie worked with Yves Lafon to
        implement CSS in Dave Raggett's Arena browser.[29][30][31] Bert Bos
        implemented his own SSP proposal in the Argo browser.[25] Thereafter,
        Lie and Bos worked together to develop the CSS standard (the 'H' was
        removed from the name because these style sheets could also be applied
        to other markup languages besides HTML).[23]
